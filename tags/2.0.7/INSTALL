PHP_FILM (7-2002)
--------

This is a quick guide in order to configure PHP_FILM in your computer.
You must follow this steps:

1- Untar php_film-xx.tar.gz into your destination directory

	# tar xzvf php_film-xx.tar.gz
	# cd php_film 

2- /* 
   --- CHANGED FROM 2.0.7 ----
   Now language config is made through config.php
   */
   Copy the language file you prefer ( php_film/lang/language_xx.php ) and
   rename it into language.php

   	# cp lang/language_en.php language.php

3- Edit the config.php file and put the webtitle you prefer and the path 
   to php_film in your computer.

4- Make sure that every .php file has execution and read permissions for 
   everybody, and the others files has read permissions for everybody.
   Dirs must be accesible by anyone. The php_film/img/film dir must have 
   write permissions for everybody.
   
   Since version 2.0, an script fixperm.sh has been added to automatically
   correct file permissions.
   
5- Now you have to create your postgres database. To do it, you have to be 
   able to create a new database. Simply type:

	# mysqladmin -u root -p create 'database_name'

   where "database_name" must be the name in the $db variable in the config.php 
   file. Note that root is not the same as the machine root(you can change 
   its password with /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password')

   You should create a new user, or use one other than root, and give him 
   permission to use the films database. It's safer. You can create a new user
   like this:

       # mysql -u root -p mysql 
       mysql> insert into user (host,user,password) 
            > values('%','username',PASSWORD('password'));
       
   Now you have to grant access into database for user 'username':

      mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,create,drop 
           > on database_name.* to username@hostname;
	   
      mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,create,drop
           > on mysql.database_name to username@hostname;

      mysql> flush privileges;
   
   where "database_name" is the name of your films database, "username" is 
   the username of the mysql user you have previously created and "hostname"
   is the system name of your computer.

   Once you have created it, you have to fill $db_user and $db_passwd with
   the mysql username and its password in order to allow phpfilm to access
   database $db_name.

   Creating a new mysql user, and setting permissions is only necessary if
   you are not going to use 'root' as the phpfilm user, but it is highly
   recommended no to do it.

   NOTE: Since version 2.0.6 it is possible to set a prefix for the table names,
   so if you set it, you should edit "tables.sql" and change table names, so
   if you set $db_prefix to "phpfilm_", tables must be called "phpfilm_film", 
   "phpfilm_actor", "phpfilm_director" and so on. If you are upgrading PHP Film
   you should login into mysql and rename tables:

   	# mysql -u user -p Films
	mysql> ALTER TABLE film RENAME as phpfilm_film;
	mysql> ALTER TABLE actor RENAME as phpfilm_actor;
	mysql> ALTER TABLE director RENAME as phpfilm_director;
	...

   Once you have created the database, you should fill it:

   	# mysql -p database_name -u username < tables.sql
 
   and make sure that no erros have ocurred. 

6- In order to close access to external people, the admin directory could  
   be password protected when you access from another machine than 
   'localhost'. To do it, you have to edit the admin/.htaccess file and
   change "/path/to/.htpasswd" into the absolute path to admin/.htpasswd 
   file (.htaccess should be 644 and .htpasswd must have 666 permission).
   For example, if you want to install phpfilm in /home/foo/phpfilm,
   you should edit /home/foo/phpfilm/admin/.htaccess and replace
   "/path/to/.htpasswd" to "/home/foo/phpfilm/admin/.htpasswd".
   
   If you don't want this feature, you should remove .htaccess and .htpasswd
   in admin directory (caution! anyone would be able to change your collection)
  
     -->  !! This feature is only available for Apache Web Server !!  <--
   
   By default, this is the login and password:

   	login: phpfilm
	password: administration

   but I recommend to change it. You have two ways to do it:

   a) Make yourself a htpasswd file for the apache, with htpasswd command.
   b) Use the link in the admin section.
   	
	b.1) To add a new user, type its name and new password twice.
	b.2) To update a user password, type its name, old password and
	     new password twice.
	b.3) To del a user, simple type its name.

Now you can go to url where you have the database and you should see a web 
page with a title but without anything else, but you shouldn't see any errors.
If so, check your configuration :-(

If you have any doubts or you want to tell me anything, simply mail me to:

NOTE: I will be very happy to know what do you think about the program, and 
      how you think it could be improved.
      
      Please, let me know :-)
